# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

mkdir
=====

Can be used to make a new folder in the directory you’re in. For example, If you are in 
```
/Users/User/Desktop
```
you’ll see the command line
```
D-921-283-148-31:Desktop User$
```
simply type ```mkdir``` followed by the name of the new folder, and terminal will create a directory with that name in your location. See `complete` branch for answers.
